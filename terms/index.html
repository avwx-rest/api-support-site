(avwx.rest) and various related services (collectively, the "Website") to you, the User, subject to your compliance with all the terms, conditions, and notices contained or referenced herein (the "Terms of Service"), as well as any other written agreement between us and you.</p> <p>In addition, when using particular services or materials on this Website, Users shall be subject to any posted rules applicable to such services or materials that may contain terms and conditions in addition to those in these Terms of Service. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.</p> <p>These Terms of Service are effective as of 2021-01-30. We expressly reserve the right to change these Terms of Service from time to time without notice to you. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this Website and these Terms of Service from time to time and to familiarize yourself with any modifications.</p> <p>Your continued use of this Website after such modifications will constitute acknowledgement of the modified Terms of Service and agreement to abide and be bound by the modified Terms of Service.</p> <p>We reserve the sole right to either modify or discontinue the Website, including any of the Website’s features, at any time with or without notice to you. We will not be liable to you or any third party should we exercise such right. Any new features that augment or enhance the then-current services on this Website shall also be subject to these Terms of Service.</p> <h2 id=account-terms>Account Terms</h2> <p>As a User, subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it. You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the sign-up process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional. If you opt for a paid Account, additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p> <p>You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.</p> <p>You must be age 13 or older in compliance with United States law. AVWX does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.</p> <p>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. The account may be used by an organization, but the responsibility must fall on an individual in that organization.</p> <p>You may not use AVWX in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction.

You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.</p> <h2 id=api-terms>API Terms</h2> <p>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to AVWX via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. AVWX, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.</p> <p>Creating multiple accounts to circumvent API access restrictions may result in the termination of all current and subsequent User accounts. You may allow down-stream Users to create their own accounts in lieu of a centralized User account.</p> <p>You may not share API tokens to exceed AVWX's rate limitations.</p> <p>You may not use the API to download data or Content from AVWX for illegal purposes.</p> <p>All use of the API is subject to these Terms of Service and the AVWX Privacy Statement.</p> <p>AVWX may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require a higher rate limit, additional services.</p> <h2 id=payment>Payment</h2> <p>Our pricing and payment terms are available at <a href=https://account.avwx.rest>account.avwx.rest</a>. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.</p> <p>We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.</p> <p>If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.</p> <p>You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option. If you choose to downgrade your account, you may lose access to content, features, or capacity of your account.</p> <p>For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account. Other refunds are entirely at our discretion.</p> <p>Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to purchase paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears.</p> <p>User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the AVWX invoice date. Amounts payable under these Terms are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in these Terms. If User fails to pay any fees on time, AVWX reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to terminate the applicable order form.
