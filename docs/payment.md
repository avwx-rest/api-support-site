# Payment Processing

### What payment methods are supported?

Most major credit cards and Apple Pay are accepted. All payments are handled by [Stripe].

### My payment didn't go through. What now?

From the [account portal][account manage], go to "Billing and Invoices" where you can update your payment information. You can add back-up payment methods as well.

### Can I get a refund?

If you're not satisfied with AVWX within your first month of your first paid plan, [email me] to get a full refund.
